Rename a local and remote branch in git
#######################################

If you have named a branch incorrectly AND pushed this to the remote repository follow these steps before any other developers get a chance to jump on you and give you s*** for not correctly following naming conventions.

1. Rename your local branch.

  If you are on the branch you want to rename:
    git branch -m new-name
  If you are on a different branch:
     git branch -m old-name new-name

2. Delete the old-name remote branch and push the new-name local branch.
     git push origin :old-name new-name

3. Reset the upstream branch for the new-name local branch.
   Switch to the branch and then:
      git push origin -u new-name

########### Or #################

git branch -m old_branch new_branch         # Rename branch locally    
git push origin :old_branch                 # Delete the old branch    
git push --set-upstream origin new_branch   # Push the new branch, set local branch to track the new remote

###############################################
See what effects will be of a merge from remote
###############################################

git checkout master
git remote show
git fetch upstream master
git diff HEAD FETCH_HEAD
# or
git difftool HEAD FETCH_HEAD
# or for one specified file
git difftool HEAD FETCH_HEAD <filename>
# then one can
git merge origin/master

How to restore origin to the same as upstream for fork
######################################################

# use gitk to find a tag way back before the probems or the intial commit
git reset --hard <very_early_tag>
# force delete all of your branches other tham master. May be OK to leave if you need them again
git branch -D <branch1>
git branch -D <branch2>
git fetch upstream master
git merge upstream/master # Your local repository now should be the same as the remote repository you forked
# now _force_ a push  to origin which get your fork to the same as your local repository 
git push --force upstream/master

Thoughts on remotes - conventions
#################################

One has various conventional names for remotes which are often set up automatically when one forks and clones. There is no mystery they are just aliases for the address of the remote repository. You can see this by

pcurtis@defiant:~/Cinnamon$ git remote --verbose
origin	https://github.com/pdcurtis/Cinnamon.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/pdcurtis/Cinnamon.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon.git (push)
pcurtis@defiant:~/Cinnamon$ 

It is convention to have origin as your own remote repository and upstream if your repository is fork of another repository which you need to keep up to date with but they could be called anything else. 

Individual branches may be tracking or non tracking branches. By default one does not pull or push remote branches other than master unless set up specifically to track or fully specified in the pul, fetch or push commands. The output above shows which branches are the defaults for push, fetch and pull.

So if we now look at our branches with various options

pcurtis@defiant:~/Cinnamon$ git branch
* master
pcurtis@defiant:~/Cinnamon$ git branch -v
* master 6b0ea0c Merge pull request #5608 from JosephMcc/window-list1
pcurtis@defiant:~/Cinnamon$ git branch -vv
* master 6b0ea0c [origin/master] Merge pull request #5608 from JosephMcc/window-list1
pcurtis@defiant:~/Cinnamon$ 

We can with the-vv option see what we are tracking as well where we are.

Now lets have a look again as we set up a remote branch:

pcurtis@defiant:~/git-documents$ git status
On branch snippets-dev
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   snippets.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
pcurtis@defiant:~/git-documents$ git commit -a -m "More edits - FETCH_HEAD and Remotes"

Note: checking out 'FETCH_HEAD'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
