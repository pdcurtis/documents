Rename a local and remote branch in git

==========================================

If you have named a branch incorrectly AND pushed this to the remote repository follow these steps before any other developers get a chance to jump on you and give you shit for not correctly following naming conventions.

1. Rename your local branch.
If you are on the branch you want to rename:
1
	
git branch -m new-name

If you are on a different branch:
1
	
git branch -m old-name new-name

2. Delete the old-name remote branch and push the new-name local branch.
1
	
git push origin :old-name new-name

3. Reset the upstream branch for the new-name local branch.
Switch to the branch and then:
1
	
git push origin -u new-name

======================

git branch -m old_branch new_branch         # Rename branch locally    
git push origin :old_branch                 # Delete the old branch    
git push --set-upstream origin new_branch   # Push the new branch, set local branch to track the new remote

=================================
